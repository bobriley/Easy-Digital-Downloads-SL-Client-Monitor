## Synopsis

This is a plugin is an enhancement to the Easy Digital Downloads WordPress plugin. It monitors Software Licensing client activity for the purposes of seeing if any clients are exhibiting abnormal activity.

Besides monitoring clients, it optionally creates commands in the .htaccess to block rogue clients.

## Motivation

We discovered that some clients have been hitting our site very frequently. Before this plugin existed, detecting rogue clients and blocking them was a tedious process.

## Installation

In the WordPress Admin go to Plugins > Add New > Upload and then activate.
